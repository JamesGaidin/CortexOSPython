# CortexOS (Python Edition)

Welcome to the Python adaptation of **CortexOS**, a symbolic cognitive framework developed by James Dayson. This repository focuses on the integration of:

- 🧠 **Selvarien** — Symbolic meaning layer
- 🧭 **Eluren** — Memory and cognitive workflow layer
- 🤖 **Halorin** — AI companion interface layer

This project is purpose-built to explore real-time symbolic AI through practical Python code, embedding memory, meaning, and conversation into an extensible architecture.

## 🧰 Layers

| Layer      | Purpose                              |
|------------|---------------------------------------|
| Selvarien  | Symbol definition & interpretation    |
| Eluren     | Memory formation & query              |
| Halorin    | Interaction layer (voice, input/output) |

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] Python dev environment
- [x] Initial repo scaffolding
- [ ] Embedding symbolic memory in vector space
- [ ] LangChain integration for prompt orchestration
- [ ] AI narrative storyteller engine (symbolic grounding)

## 🔧 Setup
