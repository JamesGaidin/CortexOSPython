## 🧷 Symbolic Safeguards

- Symbolic memory must not be used to encode harmful behavior
- Thalvenar (Perspective Layer) must not be corrupted by singular-truth enforcement
- Halorin interfaces must be bound by the **Resonant Safeguard Protocol**:
  - Loop detection
  - Ethical alignment
  - Intent verification
